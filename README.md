# InTheBeginning
My repository of who I am and goals of my work, at the beginning of TIME!!!!!
Really this is the work space I am using to show my code so I, and others, can see what I have accomplished.
If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to message me.
This repository will get edits periodically or additions that I feel need to be made.
