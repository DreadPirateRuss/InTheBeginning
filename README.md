# InTheBeginning
My repository of who I am and goals of my work, at the beginning of TIME!!!!!
Really this is the work space I am using to show my code so I, and others, can see what I have accomplished.
If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to message me.
This repository will get edits periodically or additions that I feel need to be made.
The goal will be to complete one module of Python and JS. Also I will attempt to complete 2 modules of SQL.
The modules will have more description in the readme file of each.  I like SQL and Python for different reason, but they are
both great languages to learn.

Nov 2017
Time has been constrained recently, so I have not been able to consistently work on coding as much as 
desired. We have been completing a big project at work, which is now finishing so I will be able to devote more time.

Dec 2017 update
Project is finished and I have been limited on time. I have now gathered free time to allow me to complete what I wanted. I have moved JS
to the background for the moment until I have completed SQL and Python.
